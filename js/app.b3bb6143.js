As the Philippines have been colonized by many countries, some leaving more of an impact than others, it‚Äôs impossible to say that we must abolish all ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù culture norms from the other countries. This is because our culture what it is today, is a mixture of many different cultures, this can be seen in our cuisine, language etc. The article only wishes to further drive the point that our true native culture is being lost in the borrowed culture and we shouldn‚Äôt be mimicking instead building upon them.

What makes it even more peculiar is that these words often came from people who are Filipinos themselves; as if they feel no love and connection, as if they do not feel the need to support their own. What has gone wrong, one may ask. Why are Filipinos quick to label a locally-made film baduy? Why is it often referred to as a mere version of a Western‚Äôs? Why is it even compared to such in the first place? Maybe that‚Äôs it‚Äîwhere it all went wrong. Filipinos use a standard that is not theirs as a basis to assess what is their own, resulting to them failing to appreciate and to take pride on what is theirs. They find it hard to grow some love for their own country because they are not aware: of what it truly is, of how much of a beauty it holds, of who the Filipino people truly are, and of why they are how they are. "),a("br"),a("br"),e._v(" Cruz Lucero, in her essay, explains the Filipino nature of continuously searching for something that deals with the order of the universe; that which the Western figures could have lacked. This could be seen in various Filipino literary texts. Budjette Tan and Kajo Baldismo‚Äôs Trese: Thirteen Stations allows us to have a peek on the richness of the Filipino culture as it mentions the different beliefs the Filipinos have, particularly the myths and the belief on the existence of supernatural beings who are said to be in control of the cosmos. Nikki Alfar‚Äôs The Secret History of Persya and Albanya, on the other hand, texhibits a part of our culture and some of the Filipino characteristics manifested by the characters. Such are great examples of literary works that can give the Filipinos a clearer view of their cultural identity because it is where it starts. To develop their love for their country, they must first immerse themselves in it. For being conscious of their own is also a way of fueling the heart that burns of love for their country; of nudging the Filipino people to shift their gaze from facing the west side because they have something that is even more beautiful; something they can actually relate to. This is the importance of the Filipino narratives of antiquity. Through this, Filipinos today can trace back their roots to where they can find the foundation of their identity. For them to better understand the situation of today‚Äôs society as it gives us a context of how it came to be. "),a("br"),a("br"),e._v(" The many years of being under an external power can be blamed for what seems to be historical amnesia as it is one thing the colonizers have left its former colonies. They have made the latter into something that is still dependent on them even in the present times, a mentality that has since then been ingrained in their minds. The Philippines isn‚Äôt an exception to this. Filipinos have been compelled to let go of their pre-colonial traditions calling it a process of civilizing a nation. As a result, they started to have a blurred vision of their own identity and have started to seek for a foreign standard to explain their own. It may seem difficult now to sort what is originally theirs and what is brought forth by a foreign power but movement towards Filipinization, though gradual, has already commenced. With the marriage between Filipino culture and its then-destructive husband, the foreign influence, Filipinos did well with harmonizing the two: sorting them by taking in the good traits they can inherit and kicking out the ones that suffocate them or turning it into something that caters more to the Filipinos, owning it even. This can be seen in occasions such as the celebration of Christmas; how they would retain Spanish traditions such as the Noche Buena but now in a more Filipino-style. Similarly, Filipinos should also keep their traditions but filtering it in away that is still applicable to their lives. Amador Daguio‚Äôs The Wedding Dance shows us the character of a Filipino wanting to conquer the wave and start a social change but got caught in a crossroad as she still gives importance to their traditions. As one may see from what has been mentioned, literary works as such are a great way to be more socially and historically conscious. This just proves how influential writers can be as they have the ability to preserve and immortalize traditions and cultures by re-telling them. They have the platform to mobilize readers to start developing love for their country as it is a huge step into solving a country‚Äôs problems. It is, then, every reader‚Äôs job to support this as it is their own. Progress might be a collective action, but it starts from the inside.

We always place what other powers have on a pedestal, and compare what we have to that, so it seems like whatever we make will always be inferior, or a cheap knock off. The text also discusses how we took whatever good traits or good things the foreign powers have given us, and forgot the ones we deem as harmful, in an attempt to create something of our own.

It is worth mentioning that this text mentions multiple works, such as Amador Daguio‚Äôs The Wedding Dance, where a Filipino character wants to change society, but is in conflict with traditions, and mentions how writers and their literary works can play a vital role in preserving what our traditions were, as these literary works can serve as ‚Äúimmortalizing‚Äù tools, so that we may never forget to go back to our roots, in our pursuit of modern day globalization.
