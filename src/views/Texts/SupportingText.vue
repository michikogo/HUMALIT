                CULTURE: Being Forgotten?</b-link

              When we talk about “culture” we often mean intellectual and
              creative products, including literature, music, drama, and
              painting. Another use of “culture” is to describe the beliefs and
              practices of another society, particularly where these are seen as
              closely linked with tradition or religion. But culture is more
              than that. Culture is part of the fabric of every society,
              including our own. It shapes “the way things are done” and our
              understanding of why this should be so.
              <br />
              <br />
              “Culture… is… the whole complex of distinctive spiritual,
              material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a
              society or a social group. It includes not only arts and letters
              but also modes of life, the fundamental rights of the human being,
              value systems, traditions, and beliefs.” Societies and cultures
              are not static. They are living entities that are continually
              being renewed and reshaped.
              <br />
              <br />
              Change is shaped by many factors. Cultural change occurs as
              communities and households respond to social and economic shifts
              associated with globalization, new technologies, environmental
              pressures, armed conflict, development projects, etc. Change also
              results from deliberate efforts to influence values through
              changes in the law or government policy, often due to pressure
              from civil society. There are many examples of efforts to
              influence attitudes about race relations, the rights of workers
              and the use of the environment, to name three areas in which
              cultural values shape behavior.
              <br /><br />
              New cultural definitions are formed through a process in which
              some segments of society promote change through advocacy and
              example, while others resist it. In other words, societies are not
              homogeneous and no assumptions can be made about a consensus on
              “cultural values.” Cultural values are continually being
              reinterpreted in response to new needs and conditions. Some values
              are reaffirmed in this process, while others are challenged as no
              longer appropriate.
              <br /><br />
              But most of the Filipinos nowadays have forgotten our culture, due
              to the development of new technologies; people of today are too
              much dependent on it, that’s why they weren’t able to take a look
              back on their cultures and traditions. Like Larong Pinoy which is
              popular during “Baby boomers and Generation X’’. Unlike now at the
              year of Millennial, they are embracing the high-tech gadgets,
              computer, etc.
              <br /><br />
              We as a student, a Filipino and a child of this nation wanted to
              inform you guys that we should bring back those cultures that
              disappear during modern development. Let us focus on the
              enrichment of our dying cultures, for the sake of the next
              generation who would inherit the cultures that we value and also
              let them experience what we had experience, as a part of molding
              them to be good members of our growing community.
              <br /><br />
              Stop adopting and mimicking the cultures and traditions of others,
              instead find ways to help with the rebirth of our own cultures in
              the mind, heart, and souls of every Filipinos all over the world.

              The text discusses how most Filipino’s of today’s generation have
              forgotten their own culture and have changed due to technological
              advancements and colonial mentality of the Philippine Society. It
              talks about how culture is not just about the arts but also the
              society’s way of thinking and modes of life. The text ends strong
              by asking the reader to stop mimicking other cultures and instead
              rebirth our own culture as Filipinos. What is interesting about
              this topic is that it uses the word mimicking specifically, and
              mimicking would entail copying every single aspect. As the
              Philippines have been colonized by many countries, some leaving
              more of an impact than others, it’s impossible to say that we must
              abolish all “borrowed” culture norms from the other countries.
              This is because our culture what it is today, is a mixture of many
              different cultures, this can be seen in our cuisine, language etc.
              The article only wishes to further drive the point that our true
              native culture is being lost in the borrowed culture and we
              shouldn’t be mimicking instead building upon them.

                How can PH narratives of antiquity be made relevant to

              It’s such a fascinating fact that there is no need to extensively
              rummage through the depths of social media to come across
              commentaries such as the “cheap version of (a foreign product)”
              referring to something that is Filipino-made. What makes it even
              more peculiar is that these words often came from people who are
              Filipinos themselves; as if they feel no love and connection, as
              if they do not feel the need to support their own. What has gone
              wrong, one may ask. Why are Filipinos quick to label a
              locally-made film baduy? Why is it often referred to as a mere
              version of a Western’s? Why is it even compared to such in the
              first place? Maybe that’s it—where it all went wrong. Filipinos
              use a standard that is not theirs as a basis to assess what is
              their own, resulting to them failing to appreciate and to take
              pride on what is theirs. They find it hard to grow some love for
              their own country because they are not aware: of what it truly is,
              of how much of a beauty it holds, of who the Filipino people truly
              are, and of why they are how they are.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cruz Lucero, in her essay, explains the Filipino nature of
              continuously searching for something that deals with the order of
              the universe; that which the Western figures could have lacked.
              This could be seen in various Filipino literary texts. Budjette
              Tan and Kajo Baldismo’s Trese: Thirteen Stations allows us to have
              a peek on the richness of the Filipino culture as it mentions the
              different beliefs the Filipinos have, particularly the myths and
              the belief on the existence of supernatural beings who are said to
              be in control of the cosmos. Nikki Alfar’s The Secret History of
              Persya and Albanya, on the other hand, texhibits a part of our
              culture and some of the Filipino characteristics manifested by the
              characters. Such are great examples of literary works that can
              give the Filipinos a clearer view of their cultural identity
              because it is where it starts. To develop their love for their
              country, they must first immerse themselves in it. For being
              conscious of their own is also a way of fueling the heart that
              burns of love for their country; of nudging the Filipino people to
              shift their gaze from facing the west side because they have
              something that is even more beautiful; something they can actually
              relate to. This is the importance of the Filipino narratives of
              antiquity. Through this, Filipinos today can trace back their
              roots to where they can find the foundation of their identity. For
              them to better understand the situation of today’s society as it
              gives us a context of how it came to be.

              The many years of being under an external power can be blamed for
              what seems to be historical amnesia as it is one thing the
              colonizers have left its former colonies. They have made the
              latter into something that is still dependent on them even in the
              present times, a mentality that has since then been ingrained in
              their minds. The Philippines isn’t an exception to this. Filipinos
              have been compelled to let go of their pre-colonial traditions
              calling it a process of civilizing a nation. As a result, they
              started to have a blurred vision of their own identity and have
              started to seek for a foreign standard to explain their own. It
              may seem difficult now to sort what is originally theirs and what
              is brought forth by a foreign power but movement towards
              Filipinization, though gradual, has already commenced. With the
              marriage between Filipino culture and its then-destructive
              husband, the foreign influence, Filipinos did well with
              harmonizing the two: sorting them by taking in the good traits
              they can inherit and kicking out the ones that suffocate them or
              turning it into something that caters more to the Filipinos,
              owning it even. This can be seen in occasions such as the
              celebration of Christmas; how they would retain Spanish traditions
              such as the Noche Buena but now in a more Filipino-style.
              Similarly, Filipinos should also keep their traditions but
              filtering it in away that is still applicable to their lives.
              Amador Daguio’s The Wedding Dance shows us the character of a
              Filipino wanting to conquer the wave and start a social change but
              got caught in a crossroad as she still gives importance to their
              traditions. As one may see from what has been mentioned, literary
              works as such are a great way to be more socially and historically
              conscious. This just proves how influential writers can be as they
              have the ability to preserve and immortalize traditions and
              cultures by re-telling them. They have the platform to mobilize
              readers to start developing love for their country as it is a huge
              step into solving a country’s problems. It is, then, every
              reader’s job to support this as it is their own. Progress might be
              a collective action, but it starts from the inside.

              The second text supplements the things mentioned in the first
              text, stating that Filipinos have forgotten what is theirs due to
              foreign powers imposing their process of “civilization” towards
              the ancient Filipinos, who already had a civilization in place. It
              mentions how we always tend to look outwards to be able to compare
              what we have to what they have. We always place what other powers
              have on a pedestal, and compare what we have to that, so it seems
              like whatever we make will always be inferior, or a cheap knock
              off. The text also discusses how we took whatever good traits or
              good things the foreign powers have given us, and forgot the ones
              we deem as harmful, in an attempt to create something of our own.
              This relates to how much we view our present-day culture as a
              melting pot of cultures, because we were colonized multiple times,
              and from those, we grabbed a part of their culture, and tried to
              integrate those “good things” into our own. It is worth mentioning
              that this text mentions multiple works, such as Amador Daguio’s
              The Wedding Dance, where a Filipino character wants to change
              society, but is in conflict with traditions, and mentions how
              writers and their literary works can play a vital role in
              preserving what our traditions were, as these literary works can
              serve as “immortalizing” tools, so that we may never forget to go
              back to our roots, in our pursuit of modern day globalization.

              text unconsciously does, and that is the process of taking
              something from a foreign power, and turn it into something more
              Filipino. Del Pillar’s text was mainly for satire, or to insult
              the prayers being taught to us by the spaniards. This insult to
              the primary tool of the Spaniards for the colonization of the
              Philippines shows the extent of how much we can turn their tools
              against them. To an extent, Del Pillar’s text may have awoken the
              senses of some of our country men, opening their eyes to the
              reality that they face, and this turn around through his work made
              that possible.
