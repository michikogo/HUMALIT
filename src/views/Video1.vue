    <span>
      This video focuses on the national heroes of the Philippines. This shows
      our history when we first got colonized by the Spaniards and how we are
      different from our colonizers. This makes us aware of our own national
      heroes and how we have them to thank for making the philippines its own
      country, not a province of spain or a state of the united states of
      america. We are our own people and we are unique. This is the lesson that
      Mikey Bustos wanted us to learn.
