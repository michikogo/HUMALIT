            We can see here that Mikey Bustos is speaking with the Filipino
            accent since he is proud of our accent and this accent represents
            our country. In this video he compares how different the Christmas
            celebration is in Canada and in the Philippines. This video shows
            how the filipino people are frugal with the Parol having its
            original plastic and a plastic Christmas tree. Moreover, this video
            shows our traditions where Filipinos look forward to the simbang
            gabi, how we have noche buena, and grandparents giving money to
            their grandchildren. This video shows our culture when celebrating
            christmas. This shows us that we shouldnâ€™t be ashamed of our culture
            as we are one of a kind.
